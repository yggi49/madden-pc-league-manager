Madden NFL PC League Manager
============================

General Information
-------------------

This piece of ancient PHP software allows you to manage Madden NFL 08 (PC)
leagues that play their games via network.  Administrators can maintain users,
teams, seasons, and schedules.  The software uses the stats files generated by
Madden to evaluate results and update stats and standings.

Warning
-------

The software uses the traditional LAMP stack.  Keep in mind that it was
originally built circa 2004–2005, when PHP 4.3 and MySQL 4 were
widespread. Hence, it is *very* outdated from a technical standpoint, and
comes with no warranty of any kind.

Apache Configuration
--------------------

You will need to enable mod_rewrite, and add the following rewrite rules
either to your Apache config or to the `.htaccess` file:

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/index.php$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/images/.*\.gif$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/images/.*\.jpg$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/images/.*\.png$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/scripts/.*\.js
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/static/.*/.*\.gif$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/static/.*/.*\.jpg$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/static/.*/.*\.png$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/styles/.*/.*\.gif$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/styles/.*/.*\.jpg$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/styles/.*/.*\.png$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/styles/.*\.css$
    # Add additional rewrite conditions here, e.g.
    # RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/forum/.*$
    RewriteRule .* /index.php

SQL
---

The SQL in `CREATE_DB.sql` sets up the necessary database tables as well as
one user account named `admin` with password `admin`.
